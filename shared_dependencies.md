1. Dependencies: All files share dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. These include React, React-DOM, Firebase, and TypeScript among others.

2. Exported Variables: 
   - `App` from `App.tsx` is imported in `index.tsx`.
   - `Authentication` from `Authentication.tsx`, `Folder` from `Folder.tsx`, `Subfolder` from `Subfolder.tsx`, `FileUpload` from `FileUpload.tsx`, and `DocumentView` from `DocumentView.tsx` are likely imported in `App.tsx` or other component files as needed.

3. Data Schemas: Firebase configuration details are shared in `firebaseConfig.ts` and used in `Authentication.tsx` for user authentication.

4. ID Names: IDs for DOM elements would be defined in the respective component files and used in the corresponding TypeScript files for manipulation. For example, an upload button in `FileUpload.tsx` might have an ID that's used in the corresponding TypeScript file.

5. Message Names: Any messages or alerts would be defined in the respective component files and used in the corresponding TypeScript files. For example, a success message after file upload in `FileUpload.tsx` might be defined and used in the corresponding TypeScript file.

6. Function Names: Functions defined in one file may be used in another. For example, a `handleUpload` function in `FileUpload.tsx` might be used in `Subfolder.tsx`.

7. CSS Styles: All components share styles from `main.css`.

8. Public Assets: All components use assets from the public folder, such as `index.html`, `favicon.ico`, and `manifest.json`.

9. TypeScript Configuration: All TypeScript files share the configuration from `tsconfig.json`.

10. Git Ignore Rules: All files follow the ignore rules set in `.gitignore`.

11. README: Instructions in `README.md` apply to all files.
